## Explain the use and benefits of the `pytest-sugar` and `pytest-clarity` plugins

Please provide a respond to this question after installing these plugins, using
Pytest in your terminal, and carefully studying the test suite's output. Please
make sure that you add all of the tests that you have written previously.

## Explain why `compute_tf_cookbook` does not support parameterize testing

In addition to giving a detailed answer, your response to this question should
include a fenced code block that features a Python function that is not amenable
to parameterized testing with the `pytest.pytest.mark.parametrize` marker, as
explained in Chapter 2 of the "Pytest" book.

## Provide a fenced code block with the final code coverage report for your tests

Please provide a fenced code block as part of your response to this question.
You should make sure that your output demonstrates that you have successfully
installed and used new Pytest plugins such as `pytest-sugar`.

## Briefly discuss at least three "red flags" for a software system

Use a paragraph to explain at least three red flags. Your response should
explain why these are considered red flags in the field of software engineering.

## Did you find any red flags in your implementation? How did you handle them?

Please provide a response to this question. You may use either an inline or a
fenced code block(s) in order to fully support your response.

## Explain the challenges that you encountered and how you overcame them

Please provide a detailed response to this prompt.
